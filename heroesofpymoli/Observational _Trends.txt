Observational Trends:

1. One of the main observations I made was that this games player base is made up primarily of male players (84% of all players that selected 'male')
It would also seem that it is mainly male players ages ranged from 20-24 that make up the largest number in game.

2. Another observation I made was that the 'Final Critic' was not only the most popular item but also the most profitable item in this games store.
Being familiar with games, I would like to believe this item gives players that buy it the most 'bang' for their buck.

3. Lastly, since it seems like this game is lacking in 'female' players (14% of all players that selected 'female'), in order to increase profitability
in the long run, efforts should be made to bring in 20-24 year old 'female' players since spending seems to be more prevalant in ages where
more expendable income is available without necessarily having the responsibilities older players have.
